					DATA:<br>
					    'Session_Connection_Time': How long the session lasted in minutes<br>
					    'Bytes Transferred': Number of MB transferred during session<br>
					    'Kali_Trace_Used': Indicates if the hacker was using Kali Linux<br>
					    'Servers_Corrupted': Number of server corrupted during the attack<br>
					    'Pages_Corrupted': Number of pages illegally accessed<br>
					    'Location': Location attack came from (Probably useless because the hackers used VPNs)<br>
					    'WPM_Typing_Speed': Their estimated typing speed based on session logs.<br>
					The technology firm has 3 potential hackers that perpetrated the attack.<br><br>
					Their certain of the first two hackers but they aren't very sure if the third hacker was involved or not.
					They have requested your help! Can you help figure out whether or not the third suspect had anything to do with the attacks,
					or was it just two hackers? It's probably not possible to know for sure, but maybe what you've just learned about Clustering can help!
					One last key fact, the forensic engineer knows that the hackers trade off attacks.
					Meaning they should each have roughly the same amount of attacks.
					For example if there were 100 total attacks, then in a 2 hacker situation each should have about 50 hacks, 
					in a three hacker situation each would have about 33 hacks.
					The engineer believes this is the key element to solving this,
					but doesn't know how to distinguish this unlabeled data into groups of hackers.

				<li><u>Binary Customer Churn</u></li>
				<!--
				<dd>
					A marketing agency has many customers that use their service to produce ads for the client/customer websites. They've noticed that they have quite a bit of churn in clients. They basically randomly assign account managers right now, but want you to create a machine learning model that will help predict which customers will churn (stop buying their service) so that they can correctly assign the customers most at risk to churn an account manager. Luckily they have some historical data, can you help them out? Create a classification algorithm that will help classify whether or not a customer churned. Then the company can test this against incoming data for future customers to predict which customers will churn and assign them an account manager.<br>
					The data is saved as customer_churn.csv. Here are the fields and their definitions:<br>
					Name : Name of the latest contact at Company<br>
					Age: Customer Age<br>
					Total_Purchase: Total Ads Purchased<br>
					Account_Manager: Binary 0=No manager, 1= Account manager assigned<br>
					Years: Totaly Years as a customer<br>
					Num_sites: Number of websites that use the service.<br>
					Onboard_date: Date that the name of the latest contact was onboarded<br>
					Location: Client HQ Address<br>
					Company: Name of Client Company<br>

				<li><u>Predcition of food quality</u></li>

				<dd>
					You've been hired by a dog food company to try to predict why some batches of their dog food are spoiling much quicker than intended!
					Unfortunately this Dog Food company hasn't upgraded to the latest machinery, 
					meaning that the amounts of the five preservative chemicals they are using can vary a lot, 
					but which is the chemical that has the strongest effect? 
					The dog food company first mixes up a batch of preservative that contains 4 different preservative chemicals (A,B,C,D) 
					and then is completed with a "filler" chemical. The food scientists beelive one of the A,B,C, or D preservatives is causing the problem, 
					but need your help to figure out which one! Use Machine Learning with RF to find out which parameter had the most predicitive power, 
					thus finding out which chemical causes the early spoiling! So create a model and then find out how you can decide which chemical is the problem!<br>
					    Pres_A : Percentage of preservative A in the mix<br>
					    Pres_B : Percentage of preservative B in the mix<br>
					    Pres_C : Percentage of preservative C in the mix<br>
					    Pres_D : Percentage of preservative D in the mix<br>
					    Spoiled: Label indicating whether or not the dog food batch was spoiled

				<li><u>Prediction of number of crew members required</u></li>

					Congratulations! You've been contracted by Hyundai Heavy Industries to help them build a predictive model for some ships. 
					Hyundai Heavy Industries is one of the world's largest ship manufacturing companies and builds cruise liners.
					You've been flown to their headquarters in Ulsan, South Korea to help them give accurate estimates of how many crew members a ship will require.
					They are currently building new ships for some customers and want you to create a model and use it to predict how many crew members the ships will need.
					Here is what the data looks like so far:<br>
					Description: Measurements of ship size, capacity, crew, and age for 158 cruise
					ships.<br>
					Variables/Columns<br>
					Ship Name     1-20<br>
					Cruise Line   21-40<br>
					Age (as of 2013)   46-48<br>
					Tonnage (1000s of tons)   50-56<br>
					passengers (100s)   58-64<br>
					Length (100s of feet)  66-72<br>
					Cabins  (100s)   74-80<br>
					Passenger Density   82-88<br>
					Crew  (100s)   90-96<br>
